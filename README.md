##I developed a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The project was created using VS Code as the code editor and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Real-time communication was implemented to ensure fast message delivery. The project was tested properly and uploaded to GitHub with organized code.
